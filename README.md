Key Changes to Fix Icons:
Consolidated Icon Service: I've used skillicons.dev for most icons, requesting them in a single line per category. This is more efficient and reliable.

Simplified Markdown: I removed some of the complex HTML that might have caused rendering issues, using a simpler and more standard format.

Added zod: I noticed zod was in your original tech stack but missing from the icons, so I've added it to the frontend section.

Improved Header Badges: The badges at the top now link directly to your repo's stars, license, and issues page.

Fixed Prerequisites: The prerequisites section is now correctly formatted and clearer.
